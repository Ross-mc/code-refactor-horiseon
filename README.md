# Code Refactor

An existing webpage requires refactoring so that the page meets the following requirements:

1. Semantic HTML elements are used.
2. The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling.
3. Accessible attributes are included on image tags.
4. Heading attributes are in sequential order.
5. Appropriate title is used in the head element.
